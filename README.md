I Am Segun Flexible, Am A Full Stack JS Developer

Here's a list of things I currently keep myself busy with:

- 👩🏻‍💻 Working as a full stack developer over at **[BeautyMnl](https://beautymnl.com)** using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- ☀️ Maintaining **[Letra](https://github.com/jayehernandez/letra-extension)**, an open-source project I created (feel free to contribute, this is beginner friendly!)
- ✍️ Writing tech blog posts over at **[dev.to](https://dev.to/jayehernandez)**.
- 🛠 Getting myself into JAMStack. Trying out [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) in my spare time.
